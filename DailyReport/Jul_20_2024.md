# Daily Report

woke up today and spent a long time in Starbucks, ordered a coffee that tasted like DXM syrup. had a very bad depressive episode but I managed to got out through some efforts. I don't know how long this project will continue but I do have a lot of sedatives and a plan for suicide. Not gonna discuss how I'm gonna do it but it's not as simple as just swallow all them up. Believe me, there's a very large chance you will survive, which of course is a good thing but that's not your original intention. Anyway, head to bed and hope I can last another day.
