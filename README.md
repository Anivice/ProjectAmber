# Project Amber

Project Amber is a not a documentation project, though it uses Markdown format, but more of a regular note project for myself. Here I detail everything in my schizoaffective disorder treatment path with no intention of sharing it online. This repo is solely for backup purpose only. Suicidal or other unsuitable, unregulated content may be present and I will simply not be able to be ware of their presence all the time. If you wish to proceed, you have been warned.
